# Hotel_cancellation_-prediction
Virtually all hotels across the world encounter the problem of potential guests canceling their reservations on a regular basis. This is a problem, because when potential guests cancel their reservations, this decreases the hotelâ€™s revenue, specifically accounts receivable. Another issue that arises is that other potential guests, that will not cancel their reservations, might lose the opportunity to book a particular stay at a hotel, if too many potential guests book their stay at a hotel, then cancel their reservation. This allows for a loss of revenue for the hotel, and a loss of a stay at a hotel for a potential guest.   If employees at a hotel were able to predict which potential guests would cancel their stay, they could avoid a loss of revenue for the hotel, and potential guests would be more likely to book a stay at a hotel.
